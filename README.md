  ## About the Project
  This is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
  ### Built With
  MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars
  ## Installation
  Clone the repository. Install NPM Packages (npm install)
  ## Usage
  Use command node server.js in the terminal to run. Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
